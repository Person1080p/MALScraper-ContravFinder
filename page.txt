Synopsis

   Crime is timeless. By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the
   galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like
   those on Earth. These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use,
   and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of
   tough bounty hunters.
   Spike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a
   humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted
   by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own
   troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship.
   The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child
   Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh
   Corgi.
   While developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of
   criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from
   Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike
   must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his
   old wounds.

Background

   When Cowboy Bebop first aired in spring of 1998 on TV Tokyo, only
   episodes 2, 3, 7-15, and 18 were broadcast, it was concluded with a
   recap special known as Yose Atsume Blues. This was due to anime
   censorship having increased following the big controversies over
   Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due
   to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the
   fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop
   was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the
   initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won
   Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for
   her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix,
   respectively.
   Cowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where
   it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show's
   heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it
   became a "gateway drug" to anime aimed at adult audiences.

   People who know me know that I'm not a fan of episodic anime series
   unless they're either one season (12-14 episodes) long or a slice of
   life series. Why? They have a tendency to get boring, or repetitive.
   But all rules and preferences have exceptions. You know what? Cowboy
   Bebop is that exception.
   The story is set in a space western setting - a genre and setting I'm
   loving more and more for each show I watch that falls under the genre.
   We follow two bounty hunters, Spike and Jet, who own a ship called the
   Bebop. They travel the Solar system, chasing wanted criminals to earn
   money. Along the way, they also pick up two women; the debt-laden Faye
   Valentine and the playful kid and computer genius Edward (yes,
   Ed&rsquo;s a girl).
   Each episode brings about a new bounty which they chase after, and
   while that doesn't sound too exciting to watch 26 episodes in a row,
   you'll end up loving the show. All the different events makes for a
   certain degree of unpredictability, and you'll sometimes wonder how
   things will end. However, that alone is not enough to give the story
   the rating I've given it. So why have I given that rating? Let's
   continue...
   One of the things that elevate the show a bit above the rest is the
   manner in which the main cast's pasts are explored. It's not like one
   flashback episode and you understand everything about how they are
   today. In one episode you might get one piece, and then the next one in
   another episode, and it's not until the final three episodes of the
   show that everything falls in place. This way of executing it makes you
   want to watch another episode, so that you can find out more about the
   characters (some may say that this falls in under
   &quot;Character&quot;, but the manner in which the pasts are explored
   are more &quot;Story&quot; than &quot;Character&quot;, IMO). Now,
   that's so far a 9 for the story. Why did it deserve a 10?
   The answer is easy: the way they executed many scenes in the show. The
   contrasts which you get to see between, music, the setting of scenes
   and what's really happening just gives the story that extra edge
   deserving of a perfect score.
   The characters are all really good and interesting fellows. Though they
   every now and then reminded me of characters from other shows, they
   preserved that originality which gave a feel that they were, if not
   completely, then at least a little bit more real than most characters
   out there. The way their pasts intertwine with the future and how
   everything ends with them confronting and settling open ends from their
   pasts is also something that's impressive to watch. I don't really have
   anything more to say than &quot;perfect&quot;.
   The animation is, for a 90s anime, stunningly good. The detail put into
   backgrounds and surroundings is really good, and I also love how good
   lighting effects and shading are at times. All of Ed&rsquo;s strange
   movements are animated really nicely too. If there's something
   negative, it's the somewhat dull coloring (compared to today's
   standards), as well as poor effects when traveling in hyperspace.
   The soundtrack is also astounding! The music used for the show is so
   incredibly varied, and while keeping mostly to the more jazzy tunes,
   the soundtrack visits so many genres that it's hard to not like at
   least a few pieces. What I also loved is the way the music was used not
   only as a medium to go with and amplify the mood, but also as a
   contrast to what's happening in several scenes. All in all, it's really
   amazing. Don't have anything to say against voice acting and other
   sound effects either.
   All in all Cowboy Bebop is an anime that&rsquo;s in the top tier on the
   greatness scale, and a show I believe every anime fan should give a
   try.
   To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback
   greatly appreciated =)

   Cowboy Bebop is one of those series that is just impossible to
   criticize. Not because it has no flaws, but because it has rabid fans
   who will defend it to the death. It has obtained the mythical ‚classic
   armor,‚ which is an abhorrent carte blanche, bestowed upon only the
   most overrated of anime, that is used to automatically defend against
   any sort of legitimate criticism. Cowboy Bebop certainly has good
   qualities, and it is relevant in how it influenced western perception
   of anime, but it wasn't quite groundbreaking or revolutionary in and of
   itself. You could argue that its audiovisuals were in fact
   groundbreaking, but I think a work needs more than superficial
   qualities to be truly revolutionary or great.
   Cowboy bebop borrows much from western media and pop culture in
   general. his show pays homage to or references, subtly and overtly,
   things as disparate as Antonio Banderas, Bruce Lee, John Woo, Kareem
   Abdul-Jabbar, Convoy, Biggie Smalls, Donald Duck, various mythologies
   and folktales, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Bill Evans, Stray Cats,
   Alien, blaxploitation films, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Queen, George
   Clooney, Led Zeppelin, Django and other spaghetti westerns, Herbie
   Hancock, American and Japanese professional baseball, Yellow Magic
   Orchestra, Jean-Luc Godard, Batman, B.B. King, Beverly Hills 90210,
   John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, The Unabomber, Heaven's Gate and Marshall
   Applewhite, Kiss, film noir, The Beatles, Sleeping Beauty, Bonny &
   Clyde, Ziggy Stardust, Charlie Parker, Woody Allen, Star Trek, Cool
   Hand Luke, and Taxi Driver. I kid you not. And that's not a complete
   list. References in character design and dialogue are forgivable, but
   when it straight up copies scenes and plots then I think it can be held
   against the show. I feel like I've seen Cowboy Bebop before, it's just
   been packed into a pretty package. I enjoyed a lot of these homages,
   but that does not excuse the marked lack of creativity. The mere
   evocation of a masterpiece does not make a masterpiece. Quentin
   Tarantino is an example of someone who uses pastiche and cultural
   references well, and most importantly, his references and homages don't
   make up his entire videography. There is far too little originality in
   Cowboy Bebop.
   The fact is that Cowboy Bebop is the epitome of style over substance. I
   can appreciate it for its audiovisuals, but, to me, a show needs more
   than that to be a true masterpiece. Make no mistake though, it does
   have some of the best audiovisuals I've ever seen, and could arguably
   be considered a must-watch for that alone. The OST is good (despite
   also being a tad overrated,) the art is great, and the animation is
   extremely fluid. It should also be noted that Cowboy Bebop is one of
   the few anime that holds the distinction of having an English dub
   superior to the original Japanese. The atmosphere that the audiovisuals
   achieve is their greatest quality, and is distinct in almost every
   different setting. This is not done well in most space travel anime,
   and I have to applaud Cowboy Bebop for that achievement at least.
   The main storyline consists of about 5 episodes, the rest of them being
   episodic individual stories. This wouldn't be a huge problem, but the
   episodic stories were hit or miss, and they never measured up to the
   main plot. Some of the non-main episodes focus on a character and their
   past, and this is good, but most of them are completely pointless and
   could be removed without anybody noticing. One of them was about
   fighting an alien-fungus-fridge-monster, it was an interesting and
   silly parody of Alien, but it contributed nothing to plot or character
   development. Considering how character driven this show is, that's a
   problem. There was also an entire episode paying homage to
   blaxploitation. Seeing as the allusion was presented in a more original
   way, and the episode showed a lot about Ed's character, that one was
   not only forgivable, but it was one of my favorite episodes. Like I
   said, hit or miss. There is an episode about catching a super-dog.
   There is an episode about a virus that turns people into monkeys. There
   is an episode where they chase a bomber (Woody Allen) with some help
   from a transsexual looking trucker. At least 4 episodes were easily
   10s, but more of them were closer to 5s. The first 4 episodes were
   particularly weak, which is a huge problem in a 2 cour anime. The anime
   may have had a good conclusion, but the sub-par exposition cannot be
   ignored.
   The main crew was made up of interesting and entertaining characters,
   and they prevented the episodic nature of the show from being a
   complete flop, although there were some unanswered questions about
   Faye's past in particular. Actually, strangely enough, the unanswered
   questions contributed to the splendid atmosphere. Everything had a rich
   backstory, but few flashbacks and no infodumps. This helped give the
   show its characteristic nostalgic atmosphere. One complaint I would
   have is that the main antagonist is simply not compelling, his
   motivations are somewhat unclear, and he's just one dimensional. He
   also uses a katana, even though it‚s the future, and somehow still
   manages to kick ass. He‚s just very clich√© and lame. The antagonist in
   the movie was very well done with his depth, motives, and parallels to
   Spike, and that makes me wish Vicious got the same treatment, as it
   would fit his character far better, and his character is far more
   important.
   One thing you should understand is that the characters are often good
   examples of clich√©s done well. Jet, for instance, is the typical
   hard-boiled former cop, but he is also the most empathetic of the crew.
   He is a foil to Spike and is hard working, but they also parallel in
   many ways. Ed is the teen genius/tomboy and hacker with little depth,
   but she also serves as a foil to Spike and many of his views on life.
   Faye is like a mix of all of the other characters' worst traits in
   terms of personality, but she still manages to be a sympathetic
   character. In fact, even though she keeps up her unpleasant exterior
   and despite her being the anime's main source of fanservice, she
   arguably experiences more development than any other character. Still,
   they lack any sort of real innovation, in anime or otherwise.
   Despite all my criticisms, Cowboy Bebop is cool. It's very cool. The
   characters and aesthetics were compelling (for the most part) to the
   point where I even enjoyed some of the admittedly weaker episodes. I
   can't give it a 10, it's simply not a masterpiece. I can't give it a 9,
   it's not truly great. I can't give it an 8, it's too flawed and
   unoriginal. I don‚t want to give it a 7, it was just too inconsistent.
   I have to settle on a 6.7 or so, which could be rounded either way.
   That said, an average of my story, art, sound, and character scores did
   give me around a 7.2.
   Cowboy Bebop is enjoyable and it has wide appeal; I would probably
   recommend it to just about anybody. It was up and down in terms of
   quality, and it was similar to a slice-of-life in its episodic and
   relaxed nature and its lack of an explosive climax, but it was good. I
   liked how the anime takes place after the "important part" of the main
   characters' lives is over, and nostalgia becomes a huge theme, seeing
   as it was the first anime I ever watched and it thus evokes a huge
   sense of nostalgia for me anyway. I loved the laid back atmosphere. The
   problem is that after looking through all of the episodes and rating
   them individually, I realized that the majority of it was nothing
   special. With a little restraint and reworking, Cowboy Bebop could have
   been the masterpiece that it is widely regarded as, and it does hold a
   special place in my heart regardless, even if that is only due to it
   being my first anime. That bias is probably why I choose to round the
   score to 7, rather than to 6, despite the fact that the latter is
   typically the better practice.
   I am always willing to defend and justify my scores so leave me a
   comment if you disagree, and tell me why I‚m wrong. I say that because
   this does seem to be a pretty uncommon score, even among those whose
   opinions I have great respect for. Keep in mind that a 7 is a generous
   and good score in any case.

   Cowboy Bebop was originally an anime series created by Shinichiro
   Watanabe in 1998. It consists of 26 episodes, a mini-sode, and a
   theatrical movie. It was released in America in 2001, and is one of the
   few anime franchises to be more successful in North America than in its
   native Japan. I have seen the 26 tv episodes and the movie. I already
   know what a lot of you are doing right now after glancing at the
   numerical score I gave; you're hitting up the comment box on my profile
   and writing these exact words:
   "Fuck you! Cowboy Bebop is a classic! You're not allowed to criticize
   it!"
   The more astute viewers will note that I scored the series a 6, but the
   movie a 9. I kind of like Cowboy Bebop. It does do some things very
   right. It had the potential to be one of the greatest franchises ever.
   Alas, while its production values are unmatched, the writing . . .
   doesn't always match up with the production. Because of this, the
   series ended up being a style-over-substance experience for me, but why
   was that?
   The premise of CB is that in the late 21st century, mankind has started
   living in places in the solar system besides Earth. In this future are
   bounty hunters known as Cowboys. Cowboys do whatever they can to make
   cash to keep the food stockpile stocked and their spaceships running.
   The show follows one such group of Cowboys who pilot a ship called the
   Bebop. In the beginning, we meet Spike Spiegel, a former gangster, and
   Jet Black, a former cop. As the series progresses, the Bebop also has
   Ein, a super smart dog, Faye Valentine, a woman on the run, and Edward,
   a really, really, REALLY weird hacker girl. Cowboy Bebop has been
   described as a series that has a continuous plot, and has standalone
   episodes at the same time. Having seen the series, I can tell you that
   technically, most of the episodes aren't standalone, but many of them
   are only connected by the core characters.
   Here's where one of my problems lie. When Cowboy Bebop is good, it's
   really good. The setting is very mature; it never condescends to the
   audience. The action scenes are superbly well done, the dialog is
   believable (though cheesy at times), and the atmosphere really pulls
   you in. How many episodes are actually really good? Seven. If you count
   the movie as an episode, that brings it up to eight. Eight out of
   twenty-seven episodes were good. The rest were not.
   The problem with most of the episodes is one of two things: one, it's
   really boring, or, two, it's so clich√©d, you will be able to predict
   exactly what happens by the end after the first two minutes, or both. I
   have to be honest, a lot of the episodes of CB are just plain boring.
   If this wasn't a "classic" and a more ordinary anime series, a lot of
   them would be branded as what they truly are; filler episodes. And if
   it's not boring filler, it's hackneyed.
   Watanabe is known for being a huge fan of American cinema, and that's
   obvious in CB. Unfortunately, he ripped off a lot of American movies
   virtually piecemeal. Now, you may not suspect it, but I am more
   knowledgeable of American cinema than I am Japanese animation. To
   describe it as best I can without spoiling, if you have seen at least
   one movie directed by Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, John Woo,
   and Michael Mann, then you have already seen Cowboy Bebop in another
   format. This is actually a clever trick though; most anime fans reject
   Western pop culture, and may not notice this when watching CB, so
   they'll think it's "fresh" and "original", when it's fact, it's
   actually MORE clich√©d then most anime. But hey, when CB is exciting
   and isn't (too) blatantly ripping off Hollywood, it's worth watching.
   At least, when the worthwhile characters are onscreen. I like the main
   character Spike a lot. He is the embodiment of cool, like a 21st
   century version of Steve McQueen. He's cool, but he's very human too.
   He's reckless, he makes mistakes, but he knows how to charm people, and
   he also knows how to beat his targets. I also like Jet. He's a constant
   worrywart, which is a funny contrast to his rough appearance. Some of
   the incidental characters are memorable too, (but usually only in the
   good episodes and movie). Something else I liked was the Bebop crew was
   not always a stable group, or nakama you could say. In most anime, when
   the heroes band together, nothing ever separates them. That doesn't
   happen in CB. Sometimes, the crew gets in arguments, and sometimes, one
   of them will leave the Bebop for a time, and so on. It's a touch of
   realism I appreciate.
   However, some of the characters didn't click with me. I never really
   cared for Faye. I don't dislike her, but I don't really care for her
   either. Edward is amusing, but she feels out of place in a series like
   this. The incidental characters in the less memorable episodes are just
   that, unmemorable. However, what I'm about to print in the next
   paragraph will anger thousands, possibly millions. (And maybe make
   hundreds say "Right on!") Mind you, it's just my opinion. Everything I
   print in these reviews is just my opinion; you don't have to take it
   personally, but the following opinion of mine needs to be said:
   Vicious is one of the lamest villains ever.
   The main antagonist is a man known as Vicious, someone who's still a
   part of the gang Spike came from. He's cunning, ruthless . . . and is
   absolutely lame. What's his motive? Does he just want power, or to mess
   with people? Even if so, why is he so boring to watch? The villain from
   the movie was a lot more interesting. Overall, you got two really good
   protagonists, some interesting chemistry between the protagonists,
   one-shot characters who are either interesting or not, and a
   forgettable antagonist. Yay.
   And I haven't even touched upon the ending yet! Short version, I don't
   like CB's ending. (More flames incoming! Duck and cover!) Now, the
   ending is not quite as bad as the ending for, say, Akira, or the anime
   version of Chobits. It does have a sense of finality to it, something
   most anime endings don't have. However, I did not find it "legendary."
   I found it disappointing. First of all, the ending is extremely
   predictable. It's virtually telegraphed to you before it even happens.
   Not only that, when I saw it, my reaction was, " . . . that's it?
   Seriously, that's IT?"
   But I better move on to CB's technical aspects before I get too
   letdown. Its artistry leaves no complaints. CB is probably the
   best-looking pre-digital anime I've ever seen. Even if you were to
   remake the series with digital enhancements, I doubt you could make it
   look better than it already is. Sumptuous backgrounds, top-notch
   character art, animation that ranges from above-average to really good,
   no off-model shots, this is a visual feast. The movie looks even
   better. It's obvious a lot of care was put into the visuals of CB. My
   only being the primitive CGI, but you get used to it.
   And now we touch upon CB's greatest aspect; its soundtrack. It's the
   sort of the soundtrack that makes you go, "Ah yeah, baby!" This is why
   you watch CB, the music. The music is the magnum opus of Yoko Kanno. A
   combination of jazz, blues, and rock, but it isn't just any old jazz,
   blues, and rock, it's GOOD jazz, blues, and rock. Everything from the
   opening, to the incidental music, to the endings, you get music that
   will set your soul on fire. The only anime I've seen whose soundtrack
   could rival CB's is Death Note's. Something I noticed about CB's
   soundtrack is the music sounds more like music from albums rather than
   typical soundtrack music. Another smart move; most people are
   accustomed to listening to music from CD and MP3 albums as opposed to
   soundtracks, so when they hear CB's music, it'll be more
   familiar-sounding than most other anime soundtracks. Regardless, even
   if you hate CB, you gotta score this music.
   CB is also famous for having what is perhaps the oldest English dub for
   an anime series that is considered god-like. I saw this on Adult Swim,
   and I can safely say, this is another masterpiece from Bandai and Bang
   Zoom. Every character sounds like how you would imagine them to, and
   the voices are neither wooden nor over-acted. All the different accents
   the characters have sound really cool too. I did sample the Japanese
   dub on the movie, and I will say, Spike and Jet sound really good in
   both Japanese and English, but I will never get used to Faye's Japanese
   voice. Yeah, this is one you gotta see in English. (Though in
   retrospect, the Japanese performances aren't bad, it just doesn't click
   like the English dub)
   While CB is still often regarded as a classic, I'm not the first to
   criticize it like so. There has been some backlash against CB in recent
   years. Some people complain it's not "Japanese-y" enough, that it's too
   Western. I mentioned that earlier, but there is another anime I've
   seen, Baccano, which is also very similar to American movies, but it
   was consistently entertaining, and not as predictable as CB, so I did
   not mind. Others have mentioned the same things I have, that it's
   boring, the plot isn't strong enough, it's style over substance. This
   isn't a disaster by any means, but I do have to say that, outside of
   the production values, CB is one of the most overrated anime I've seen.
   It's not one of the worst, certainly not, but it's not quite the
   experience I was promised either. To put it in other words, there were
   some episodes that I would score a 4 out of 10. And yet, there are some
   episodes, including the movie, that I would score a 9 out of 10. The 6
   overall is just from mixing the good episodes with the bad.
   I like to imagine that in an alternate dimension, CB was an OVA series
   instead of a tv series. All the episodes I do like, (# 2, 8, 12, 13,
   17, 20, and 22) were released on separate OVAs, as well as a few others
   to bridge the plot gaps. Then a theatrical came out (Knocking on
   Heaven's Door), and then another to end it all (The Real Folk Blues,
   albeit with a revised conclusion), and it would be grandiose. Alas, I
   don't live in that universe. Hey, Shinichiro Watanabe likes drawing
   influence from Hollywood, right? What's something it's doing a lot of
   right now? Continuity reboots? He could still do that. I can dream,
   can't I?

   Only a few anime series or movies could be considered true classics,
   and one of the most notable shows to fall into this category is iconic
   not just for its style, design and animation, but also for the depth of
   its characters and its music.
   That anime is Cowboy Bebop.
   Story
   Cowboy Bebop is told as a series of standalone episodes, each of which
   is only really connected to one another by the characters, with very
   few of them directly following on from one another. This method of
   storytelling is now termed as &ldquo;episodic&rdquo;, and while the
   format is now commonplace in anime, this series set the standard in its
   usage, and many purists believe it to be almost flawless in its
   execution of this storytelling style.
   Sunrise, the production company behind the show, used this format as a
   tool to develop the characters in the show, and whilst many episodes
   are unique in terms of story content and plot, there is a strong
   connection to the rest of the series due to the strength of the
   characters, something which also applies to the movie Knocking on
   Heaven&rsquo;s Door.
   One of the big advantages to the show's storytelling method is that it
   allows the viewer to jump straight into the story at almost any point,
   however it should be noted that many shows that adopt the episodic
   format are often let down by poor character development. The fact that
   the series manages to develop its characters, and develop them well, is
   a testament to the strength of the individual episodes as standalone
   stories, and the personal history of each character (which becomes
   clearer as the series progresses). In essence, Cowboy Bebop is a more
   about the characters themselves and their relationships with each
   other, than it is about their &ldquo;adventures&rdquo;. There are a
   number of episodes where the viewer may feel a strong connection to the
   characters, their history,mannerisms, pet peeves, etc, something which
   is difficult enough to accomplish in a normal sequential story.
   Achieving this in an episodic story is a mark of the quality of the
   series.
   Art/Animation
   The animation in Cowboy Bebop is amongst the best seen in anime, and
   even though it is now over a decade old, it still manages to hold its
   own in terms of animation and character design with more modern action
   oriented shows. Sunrise, who generally do an excellent job on
   animation, really pushed the boat out with this series, and when
   compared with other shows that were released around the same time
   (Outlaw Star for example), it can clearly be seen that the art,
   animation and character design in Cowboy Bebop is something special.
   The animation during the numerous action sequences is especially
   impressive and the character movements are free-flowing and
   naturalistic.
   The art, while not vibrant with flashy colours, portrays the feeling,
   attitude and environmental influences for the characters perfectly. The
   numerous locales which the crew of the Bebop visit are rendered in
   stunning detail, adding a surreal sense of realism to the show, whilst
   the character designs were a work of brilliance, and allows each
   character a mark of individuality even before they spoke.
   Sound
   The quality of the soundwork used in Cowboy Bebop is what really sets
   it apart from other anime series. The music was composed by the world
   renowned Yoko Kanno, and performed by The Seatbelts, a band
   specifically formed by Kanno to perform the music for the series. The
   music is a strange mix of blues, classic rock and jazz, and while at
   first this may seem an odd choice for a sci-fi series, the music works
   extremely well in the setting as it reflects the generally
   lackadaisical attitude adopted by the crew of the Bebop. Even today,
   the soundtrack for this anime is unique in terms of style and
   composition. The opening theme, Tank!, has become one of the most
   influential pieces in anime history, and one of the few anime based
   music tracks to be appreciated by music lovers with no background in
   anime or manga.
   The sound effects in the series are also well done. The various
   locations are vibrant with background noises, from the hum of the
   Bebop's engines and the sound of gulls by the sea, to the hubbub of a
   crowded street. The many gunshots and explosions are clear and sound
   almost as though you're standing right in the middle of the wild gun
   battles.
   Whilst the Japanese voice actors do an excellent job with each of the
   four main characters, this is one of the rare anime shows out there
   where many prefer the English cast over the original Japanese. Cowboy
   Bebop is one of the few anime in existence where the English dub is
   equal to, if not better than, the original Japanese version.
   Characters
   Cowboy Bebop has some of the most original and memorable characters to
   appear in anime. Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are four of the most enigmatic
   individuals to found in the medium, and upon seeing them, the viewer
   will probably wonder how they work together when all of them come from
   diversely different backgrounds with opinions that clash with one
   another.
   Spike and Jet are most definitely &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; of sci-fi
   anime, or indeed any genre of anime you care to name. Their conflicting
   personalities bounce off each other like peas on a drum, and once Faye
   is added to the mix it becomes a potent brew of character interaction.
   It is through this interaction that the viewer is more able to
   empathise with each character, and the slow but steady revelations
   about their pasts, told wonderfully through flashbacks and reunions,
   have far greater impact because of this empathy. The characters are so
   well defined that many scenes which would normally appear mundane in
   other anime are just as memorable in this series as the action scenes
   (one springs to mind - Spike and Jet eating eggs after Faye, Ed and Ein
   leave the ship).
   Enjoyment
   Cowboy Bebop is a sci-fi western with equal parts humour and
   seriousness, and is already considered by many within the anime
   community to be a classic. There is a level of sophistication in both
   the story and its characters that is rare for a show, regardless of
   whether it is an anime or not. The great cast, the heavy drama tempered
   with bouts of comedy, the excellent music, all serve to cement its
   place in the hearts and minds of anime fans the world over. It is a
   testament to its quality that there is only one show, anime or
   otherwise, that can be held up as a fair comparison (Joss
   Whedon&rsquo;s Firefly). This is considered by many to be a
   &ldquo;must-see&rdquo; series as it is a testament to what can be
   achieved in anime with the right ingredients.
   The only downside to this anime would be the lack of a continuous
   story. Because of this, the series lacks the &quot;epic saga&quot; feel
   upon which many sci-fi stories are judged. However, the depth of each
   character, together with the strength of their individual stories, is
   more than enough to carry this series.
